<h2>About ME!!</h2>
<br>
<p>
Cookie Monster is a blue Muppet character on the long-running PBS/HBO children's television show Sesame Street.
In a song in 2007, and later in an interview in 2017, Cookie Monster revealed that his real name is Sidney Monster.
He is best known for his voracious appetite and his famous eating catchphrases, such as "Me want cookie!"
Although he eats almost anything, including normally inedible objects, as his name suggests, his preferred food is cookies.
Chocolate chip cookies are his favorite kind.
Despite his voracious appetite for cookies, Cookie Monster shows awareness of healthy eating habits for young children and also enjoys fruits and eggplant.
He is known to have a mother, a younger sister, and an identically-designed cousin (who does not like cookies). All three share his characteristic blue fur and "googly eyes".
He also has a father, who appeared in a Monsterpiece Theater sketch promoting energy conservation, water conservation and environmentalism. Cookie Monster's mother and father both share his enormous appetite and craving for cookies.
